### 2. CONTEXT

Your task is to model an online commerce application. You will sell tangible items online (auto parts and tools, clothing, shoes, computer parts and accessories, electronics and gadgets, etc.). Thus, a user can purchase these items directly from your web store. The content and type/category of items sold are left to your discretion.

### 3. PHASES

The project will be divided into 4 phases to facilitate development:

#### a) Commercial Web Page (Landing Page)

Customers can consult the web page to obtain important information about the business, services/products offered, and other relevant information. Customers cannot browse or shop on the website, as no interactive catalog will be present. Typical use: restaurants and small street vendors.

#### b) Showcase Website (Magazine)

Customers can browse the showcase website, search, sort, and apply filters to different products/services offered. Customers can view details of each product and know their status. Merchants can manage products and inventory. Typical use: merchants offering custom or order-based products.

#### c) Transactional Website

Customers can use the transactional website to shop, complete an order, and track their orders. Merchants can manage customers and orders. Typical use: merchants wanting an online presence but lacking the infrastructure for online deliveries and payments.

#### d) E-Commerce

Customers can use the online store to make a complete purchase, including ordering, payment, and delivery tracking. They can also track their orders. Merchants can manage payments and deliveries. Typical use: all modern e-commerce businesses.
